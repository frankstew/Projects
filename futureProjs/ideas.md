Data survey thing:
- Landing page then sign up to answer q's
- also have data sets to compare yourself to (some q's will some wont)
- ML models to find cool trends
- need to associate data with user otherwise only able to do plots
  - need to do that anonymously
- databse:
  - depends how we set it up, Nosql seems to make more sense
  - Nosql?
    - user model
    - q's associated with user (hashed so I cant see users?)
    - or questions with numbers of answers (also?)
  
  - SQL:
    - each q is in a db
    - has different users assocaited with it or something?

Finding cheapest store with item:
- can have users and stuff
- db:
  - SQL:
    - item has stores it is available at, price, other useful stuff. db gets updated regularly
  - Nosql:
    - items have prices and store, or stores have items and items have prices. gets updated regularly, seems a little messy.
